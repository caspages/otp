# Geofield

Geofield is an advanced module for storing, managing and representing dynamic
Geographic data in Drupal. It supports all geo-types (points, lines, polygons,
multi types geometries, etc.), and integrates with various Js Mapping Libraries
(Google Maps, Leaflet, etc.) and advanced Geocoding / Reverse Geocoding
functionalities, via many other Drupal Geo Mapping modules.

For a full description of the module, visit the
[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/geofield).

## Requirements

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.


## Installation

The Geofield module needs to be installed
[using Composer](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies),
it means simply running the following command from your project root:

__$ composer require drupal/geofield__

This process will also download the required <a href="https://github.com/phayes/geoPHP" title="GeoPHP library" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GeoPHP library</a> dependency,
that will be sited in the /vendor folder.
For further information, see
[Installing Drupal Modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/extending-drupal/installing-drupal-modules).


## Configuration

Once enabled the module it will be possible to add a "Geofield" field type to
any entity type/bundle and then choose the preferred widget or formatter.


## Advanced Mapping and Geocoding with Geofield

It is possible to implement Advanced Mapping and Geocoding functionalities
adding compatible and specialized modules for Drupal, such as:

- [Geofield Map](https://www.drupal.org/project/geofield_map): an advanced,
complete and easy-to-use Geo Mapping solution that lets you manage the Geofield
with an interactive Map both in back-end and in the front-end;
- [Leaflet](https://www.drupal.org/project/leaflet): Drupal advanced integration
with the Leaflet JS mapping library. Advanced features for creating and editing
Points and Geometries Layers (Linestring, Polygon) so as for managing Leaflet
Views styles and Formatters;
- [Geocoder](https://www.drupal.org/project/geocoder): most advanced, complete
and easy to use solution to process Geocode and Reverse Geocode operations on
Drupal Entities;
- [Address](https://www.drupal.org/project/address): Provides functionality for
storing, validating and displaying international postal addresses;
- [Search API Location](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_location):
Adds geospatial-based searching to the Search API module;
- etc. (others created in the wild of the Drupal community);

## Api Notes

### Geofield Schema

Geofield fields contain nine columns of information about the geographic data
that is stores. At its heart is the 'wkt' column where it stores the full
geometry in the 'Well Known Text' (WKT) format. All other columns are metadata
derived from the WKT column. Columns are as follows:
```
'wkt'          Raw value. By default, stored as WKB, loaded as WKT
'geo_type'     Type of geometry (point, linestring, polygon etc.)
'lat'          Centroid (Latitude or Y)
'lon'          Centroid (Longitude or X)
'top'          Bounding Box Top (Latitude or Max Y)
'bottom'       Bounding Box Bottom (Latitude or Min Y)
'left'         Bounding Box Left (Longitude or Min X)
'right'        Bounding Box Right (Longitude or Max X)
'geohash'      Geohash equivalent of geom column value
```


### Save or Updated a Geofield programmatically

To save or update programatically a Geofield (both single and multivalue) it is sufficient to pass the WKT values/geometries to the

{Drupal\geofield\Plugin\Field\FieldType\GeofieldItem} setValue public method

For instance in case of a node entity containing a geofield named "field_geofield",
it is possible to update/set its multiple values in the following way:

     // The location of the Empire State Building, in New York City (US)
     $empire_location_lon_lat = [-73.985664, 40.748441];

     // Generate the WKT version of the point geometry: 'POINT (-73.985664 41.748441)'
     $empire_location_wkt = \Drupal::service('geofield.wkt_generator')->wktBuildPoint($empire_location_lon_lat);

     // Generate the (first) geofield value in the proper format.
     $geofield_point = [
     'value' => $empire_location_wkt,
     ];

     // Generate the (second) geofield value in the proper format.
     // The permiter of Bryant Park, in New York City (US)
     $geofield_polygon = [
     'value' => 'POLYGON((-73.98411932014324 40.754779803566606,-73.98502054237224 40.75354445673964,-73.98186626457073 40.75221155678824,-73.98092212699748 40.75344692838096,-73.98411932014324 40.754779803566606))',
     ];

      // Get the wanted entity ($id of a node in this example) and set the
      // 'field_geofield' with the goefield values/geometries
      $entity =  \Drupal\node\Entity\Node::load($id);
      $geofield = $entity->get('field_geofield');
      $geofield->setValue([$geofield_point, $geofield_polygon]);
      $entity->save();
