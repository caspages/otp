2010-12-31 Footnotes 2.5

Major features

 - Add new addon module: Footnotes with Views by AlexisWilke. [#939738]

Smaller fixes

 - Remove "DEPRECATED" text from Better URL filter and instead have a small 
   "Note" about it not being available in Footnotes 7.x-x.x. [#1002436]
 - Correctly ignore also a tag containing linebreak between the &gt; and &lt;.

   Bug [#974760]

The intention is to branch a Drupal 7 version out of this release.

2010-10-03 Footnotes 2.4

Major features

 - Add Footnotes Wysiwyg module with TinyMCE AND CKEditor support.
   This deprecates Footnotes TinyMCE module, which is kept around for backward
   compatibility.
   [#728642]
 - Add i18n support via Drupal.t() also to TinyMCE module. [#672034]
 - New feature (option): Collapse identical footnotes into one, as if using same 
   value="". [#808214]
 - Implement [#728658] Highlight footnote when clicking the link. Add mention in 
   README.txt how to change the highlight color if needed (Footnotes cannot know 
   what is an appropriate color, I picked #eeeeee as the safest choice).

Smaller fixes

 - Bug [#761390]
   Two small improper CSS names
   ...was fixed by changing underscores to dashes in css selectors/classes.
 - Deprecate Better URL filter as it is committed to Drupal 7 now. [#296208]
 - Bug [#761664] 
   Footnotes are double numbered when CSS is not used, such as in RSS feeds. 
   (Due to using OL list)
   ...was fixed by migrating to UL list. This is also appropriate since after
   introduction of the value="" parameter the footnotes needn't comprise an
   ordered list.


2010-02-25 Footnotes 2.3

 - Reset $used_values in _footnotes_replace_callback() after use. [#723446]

2010-01-17 Footnotes 2.2

 - Add TinyMCE support as a separate plugin tinymce_footnotes 
   (thanks elgreg #464066)
 - Can have multiple references to same footnote in body by repeating value=""
   (#636808)
Small fixes
 - Move translations from "po" to "translations" subdirectory. #430656
 - Rename footnotes-alternative_layout.css due to typo in filename.
 - fix css: Use "ol.footnotes li" instead of "ol.footnotes" as selector for 
   "list-style-type: none." Makes it stronger.
 - fix html: columns="" should be cols="" bug: #687244
